Institutions can become active partners (training hubs), so that they provide regular
training for there areas.  Hubs have at least one local instructor
committed to organizing a workshop at least once a year, and then.


## Current hubs


* Aalto University, Helsinki region, sponsored by [Aalto Scientific
  Computing](https://scicomp.aalto.fi/).
  Workshops every May (Helsinki)/December (Aalto) in partnership with
  the University of Helsinki.
* KTH, Stockholm, sponsored by [PDC](https://www.pdc.kth.se/).
  Workshops every March-April and October-November.
* NTNU, Trondheim, sponsored by ??.  Workshops every February and November.
* University of Oslo, sponsored by ??.  Workshops every June (and
  possibly more).

## Become a hub

There is no particular application process here: one simply sponsors a
first workshop, then a second, and then eventually it becomes a
regular thing.  There should be at least one local instructor who can
regularly take part in other CodeRefinery activities and several
helpers.

To get started, consider attending another workshop as a helper
(optional), then [request a workshop](/workshops/), then [join our
chat and become an instuructor](/get-involved/).  When you would like
to be add to the list above, send a pull request.

## Hub cooperation

As part of the CodeRefinery sustainably plan, we hope that hubs can
share instructors in-kind: since a workshop needs at least two or
three instructors, instructors can travel between hubs so that we
maintain community, share knowledge, and continue workshops.

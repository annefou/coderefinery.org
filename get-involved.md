Welcome!

### Workshop helpers

Have you already participated in a Carpentry or CodeRefinery workshop, but
would like to attend another one to refresh your memory and share your own
knowledge? Or do you already have a solid background in research software
engineering and would like to meet like-minded people in a friendly
environment? Join a Carpentry or CodeRefinery workshop as a helper! [Get in
touch](/get-involved/#contact-us) and let us know which workshop you would like
to join.


### Become an instructor

CodeRefinery instructors organise and teach both CodeRefinery and Carpentry
workshops to spread data literacy, programming skills and best software
practices in the Nordics.

If you would like to become an instructor for CodeRefinery and/or Carpentry
workshops, you should begin by participating in a 2-day [Carpentry instructor
training event](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/). Please
[get in touch](mailto:support@coderefinery.org) if this sounds interesting.


### Contribute to teaching material

All our lessons are [on GitHub](https://github.com/coderefinery). Contributions
to the lesson material are highly welcome! The best way to contribute is via
the forking-pull request workflow. See our lesson on [collaborative version
control](https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/02-distributed/) for
an overview of how this works. You can also [contact us](/get-involved/#contact-us) via other
channels.


### Reuse our material

We very much encourage reusing our lessons and contributing changes: [github.com/coderefinery](https://github.com/coderefinery/)

### Become a partner

Coderefinery started as a sponsored and funded project, but we are
encouraging more partnerships to stay sustainable long-term.  In
general, we image a reciprocal relationship for academic institutions:
you help us run workshops, we give workshops at your institution.
Join our chat (Zulip, below) and talk to us.  There's no formal
process yet and we don't even know exactly how it will work, so join
and have some influence.


## Contact us

### Zulip

We use [Zulip](https://zulipchat.com) to discuss within our team and community.
We discuss in the open and you can join us on
[https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com): you
can listen in, follow certain threads, participate, and influence.

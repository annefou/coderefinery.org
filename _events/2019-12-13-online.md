### December 13, 2019

CodeRefinery is organizing a one day online "open house" dedicated to discussions and development of the CodeRefinery training material.

---

### Welcome to the first CodeRefinery Open House!

The idea behind this event is to bring together people who are interesting in
contributing to [CodeRefinery training material](https://coderefinery.org/lessons/).

Anyone who would like to contribute, learn how to contribute to the CodeRefinery training material is very welcome to join.

We first meet online at 9:00 am (UTC + 1) via Hangout and then work on CodeRefinery training material. During the day, we will coordinate the work through our [zulip](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com/) channel with possibilities to further discuss via Hangout if necessary.

Shared document for live editing: https://hackmd.io/1Sso1UFMTXKihv1sedsTIA

We conclude the day around 4:00pm (UTC + 1) by writing a short blog/summary in a shared document.

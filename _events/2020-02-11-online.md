### Welcome to the second CodeRefinery Open House!

Following up our successful first CodeRefinery Open House, we will have our second online Open house!

The idea behind this event is to bring together people who are interesting in
contributing to [CodeRefinery training material](https://coderefinery.org/lessons/).

Anyone who would like to contribute, learn how to contribute to the CodeRefinery training material is very welcome to join.

We first meet online at 9:00 am (UTC + 1) via Hangout and then work on CodeRefinery training material. During the day, we will coordinate the work through our [zulip](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com/) channel with possibilities to further discuss via Hangout if necessary.

We conclude the day around 4:00pm (UTC + 1) by writing a short blog/summary in a shared document.
